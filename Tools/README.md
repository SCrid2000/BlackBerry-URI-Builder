BlackBerry-URI-Builder
======================

Tools
These tools must be placed in a folder with blackberry-signer.bat, blackberry-signer, and the lib folder from the BlackBerry SDK.
These files are the property of BlackBerry and a part of their SDK, and have not been uploaded to this repository. You can extract them yourself from a BB10 SDK installation, or download them directly from:

signURI.bat can be used to easily sign your URI after it has been created. 
sideloadFile.bat was made by HaTaX for easily sideloading .bars to your BlackBerry 10/PlayBook.
